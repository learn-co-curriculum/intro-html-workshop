# Exercise
Welcome to the 1990s. You are a passionate music fan with an ear to the ground for the next big thing. You are so convinced of the longevity of your favorite band, that you decide to make a monument to them on the WORLD WIDE WEB(tm).

### Goal
Using your newfound HTML skills and the example code in `index.html`, create a webpage for your favorite 90s band or one hit wonder. Incorporate a title, image, header, paragraphs and any other HTML elements of your choosing.

### View your webpage
To view your webpage in the browser, on Mac control+click and select `Show in Finder`. Then double click on the html file to open it in your browser.

If you are on PC, we'll figure it out together!
